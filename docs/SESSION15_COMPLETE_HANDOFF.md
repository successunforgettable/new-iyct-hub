## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

**ALL UI must use this dark theme. No exceptions.**

```css
--background: #0a1628;
--nav-background: #0d1829;
--card-background: #1a2332;
--card-border: #2a3b52;
--accent-cyan: #5dade2;
--success-green: #34c38f;
--warning-orange: #f0ad4e;
--error-red: #dc3545;
--text-primary: #ffffff;
--text-secondary: #a0a0a0;
```

**CRITICAL:** If any design from Inner DNA exports conflicts with this, CHANGE IT to match our hub design.

- Vimeo video player embed
- Activity triggers based on type code

### Step 4: Practice Tools Landing
Create the 6-tool carousel page:

1. **Read Master Plans First** - Check all addition documents before coding
2. **Design System is Law** - Use exact color values, no deviations
3. **Match PHP Functionality** - System must not look radically different
4. **Surgical Fixes Only** - Don't recreate entire files
5. **Activity Types Matter** - Use correct code mapping (0-24)
6. **Document Everything** - Update handoffs after each session
